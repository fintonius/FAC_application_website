# FAC_application_website

For the project I want to build my first complete website. It's 
something I have been avoiding doing for most of the time I've 
been learning web-development as it's quite a daunting task! I
also haven't been pushed to do it before so have managed to avoid
it til now.

I want to showcase as much as I can of the knowledge I have learned
over the past year and a half of learning web dev part time. I also
want to try new things and stuff I have tried in the past but have
not enjoyed and/or found too difficult so have avoided where possible!

This will include:
    
    - using grid to layout at least some pages and/or elements within pages.
    - creating a grid of images that can be opened into a single image viewer
    - maintaining consistent layout across pages
    - having dynamically resizing elements within pages that don't break
    layout
    - incorporating different file types, such as svg, jpg and video into
    the same pages
    - work with 'clean/readable code' as much as possible. Keeping consistent
    naming conventions as much as possible!
