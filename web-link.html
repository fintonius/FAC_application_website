            <h1>Etch-A-Sketch</h1>
            <p>This is a project I completed as part of the Odin Project
                course I have been slowly working my way through. This was a very 
                involved project but ultimately very enjoyable. It helped me see the 
                creative potential of web-development!

            <h1>Calculator</h1>
            <p>Another project I completed for the Odin Project. Another difficult
             one though still very enjoyable and satisfying once completed.

            <p>You guessed it, <i>another</i> Odin Project undertaking! And yes,
                also difficult, contrary and very very frustrating. I had started
                to notice a theme with web-dev stuff by this stage.

            <h1>Rock/Paper/Scissors</h1>
            <p>
                This was an early game project I completed as part of the Odin Project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though this is much simpler and in many ways less ambitious than
                my subsequent projects I very much enjoyed completing it and the sense of 
                achievement at having made something by myself and overcome the many, <i>many</i>
                problems I encountered showed me that coding was something I could get immense
                enjoyment and pride from.

            <h1>Cuppa</h1>
            <p>
                This is the game I created for my application to the 
                Founders and Coders bootcamp course.

            <p>
                As someone who gets very bored and very distracted very easily (I am currently waiting
                on assessment for adult ADHD) I can't even wait for the kettle to boil without needing
                to find something to do - so I try to throw the teabag into the cup before the kettle 
                boils.

            <p>
                I am embarrasingly bad at it...
